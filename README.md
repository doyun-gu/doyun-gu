## 👋 About Me

I’m currently studying **Electrical and Electronic Engineering**, and I'm on a **placement year (2024–2025)** at **Aston Martin**. I will be returning to university to complete my final year in **2025–2026**.

I’m passionate about working across both hardware and software domains:

- 🧠 I enjoy **firmware development**, working with embedded systems at the low level.
- 🛠️ I love **PCB design**, from schematic capture to layout and manufacturing.
- 📊 I also have a strong interest in **data analysis**, transforming raw data into actionable insights.
